Lipulekh (elevation 5,200 m or 17,060 ft) is a Himalayan pass on the border
between India's Uttarakhand state and the Tibet region of China,[1] near their
trijunction with Nepal. Nepal has ongoing claims to the southern side of the pass,
called Kalapani territory, which is controlled by India.[2][3] The pass is near
the Chinese trading town of Taklakot (Purang) in Tibet and used since ancient
times by traders, mendicants and pilgrims transiting between India and Tibet.
It is also used by pilgrims to Kailas and Manasarovar.
